== Description ==

Connect LearnDash to Pexelle via secure QR handoff. Share and verify certificates, or export clean JSON for integrations.


Key features:
- ðŸ”— **Seamless integration** with LearnDash courses  
- ðŸ“± **QR code login & sharing** (device handoff support)  
- ðŸŽ“ **Certificate transfer** to Pexelle infrastructure  
- ðŸ”’ **Secure one-time login flow** with approval system  

This plugin is ideal for educators and institutions who want to make certificate verification **modern, secure, and easy to share**.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/pexelle-learndash` directory, or install it directly from the WordPress plugin repository.
2. Activate the plugin through the **'Plugins'** screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to your LearnDash courses and configure QR sharing options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require LearnDash? =
Yes. You must have **LearnDash LMS** installed and active.

= Is the QR secure? =
Yes. The QR codes generate a **short-lived, one-time token** and require approval from the userâ€™s main device before login is completed.

= Can I customize the modal and design? =
Yes. The plugin includes frontend CSS classes (`psl-modal`, `psl-btn`, etc.) that you can override in your theme or child theme.

= Does it work with multisite? =
Currently tested on single-site WordPress. Multisite support is planned.
